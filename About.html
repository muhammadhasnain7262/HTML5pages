<h1>What makes Hostelz.com unique?</h1>
<p>So many things! Here's a list of some of the major differences that put Hostelz.com in a completely different league to any other online hostels guide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostelz.com has the largest hostels database on the web. In fact it's now the only comprehensive worldwide hostels database. The other sites only list hostels in their booking system, so many awesome properties are missed. We list all hostels worldwide, for free.</li>
<li>We include direct phone and website contact information for hostels in their listings (when available). Other sites would never do that because they are really just booking systems, not hostel guides.</li>
<li>When you want to make a booking, our system searches and displays results from all of the major hostel booking sites so you can choose the lowest price and the best availability no matter what.</li>
<li>Hostelz.com offers only genuine reviews. We never allow hostels to censor reviews about their hostel. We believe you should be able to read everyone's opinions about every hostel, both good and bad.</li>
<li>In addition to user-submitted reviews, we also have paid reviewers who visit each hostel in person to write more thorough comprehensive reviews (these appear at the top of the page, separate from the user reviews at the bottom of the page).</li>
<li>Photographs of each hostel show our users what each hostel really looks like on a typical day, not just the glossy, instagram-perfection of photos provided by the property.</li>
<li>We also give you ratings and full reviews from the major hostel booking sites. This way you get the complete picture of how each hostel is rated.</li>
<li>We take all of the ratings from our site combined with ratings around the web, and calculate the Hostelz.com Combined Rating for each hostel. This is a special weighted average that takes into consideration the number of reviews. The Hostelz.com Combined Rating is the single most reliable indicator of the quality of the hostel that exists anywhere.</li>
<li>We've been online for more than 19 years (since 2002), so you know it's a website you can trust.</li>
<li>We could keep going, but those are at least some of the major points. And we are not done yet. We're working on many more neat new features that will be going live on the site this year. So stick around, it only gets better.</li>
</ul>
